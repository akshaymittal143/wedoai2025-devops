## 🤖 AI Components Deep Dive

### Vulnerability Prioritization
Our AI system analyzes CVEs in context:

```python
# Example AI analysis output
{
  "cve": "CVE-2023-XXXX",
  "severity": "CRITICAL", 
  "ai_priority": 1,
  "reasoning": "RCE in image processing library affects file upload endpoint",
  "business_impact": "HIGH - public-facing service",
  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

### Anomaly Detection
ML-powered monitoring that understands your application:

```python
# Detected anomaly example
{
  "anomaly": "error_rate_spike",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "explanation": "300% increase in 404 errors suggests enumeration attack",
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Enable rate limiting on product catalog endpoints",
    "Review WAF logs for suspicious patterns"
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Demo: See It In Action

### 1. Run Local Demo
```bash
# Start the application
make build
docker run -p 5000:5000 wedoai2025-devops:latest

# Visit http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Trigger Security Scan
```bash
# Run comprehensive security analysis
make scan

# View AI-generated vulnerability report
cat security-report.json
```

### 3. Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
# Deploy with security policies
make deploy-k8s

# Check policy enforcement
kubectl get cpol  # View Kyverno policies
kubectl get pods  # Verify secure deployment
```

### 4. AI Anomaly Detection
```bash
# Run ML-powered monitoring demo
make demo-ai

# View explainable AI report
cat anomaly_report_*.txt
```
